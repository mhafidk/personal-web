				Hi! My name is <span class="text-lime-500 font-semibold">Muhammad Hafid Khoirul</span>, you
				can call me Hafid. Nice to meet you! I’m a web developer living in Bogor, Indonesia.
			</p>
			<p class="mt-4">
				At the moment, I’m working as backend engineer at <a

					target="_blank"
					class="text-lime-500">Qontak</a
				> where I'm helping delivering new features and optimizing the current ones. I'm more focused
				on backend side right now, but I have to say that I had a lot of fun learning and doing the frontend
				part.
			</p>
			<p class="mt-4">
				I have been working as web developer professionaly since 2020, that means I have 2 years of
				experience now! There are still a lot of things I have to learn, but of course I also learnt
				a lot from my experience.
			</p>
			<p class="mt-4">
				Beside web development, I'm also interested in IoT and computer vision, doing small projects
				in my spare time, cause it's fun! My undergraduate thesis was about computer vision, you can
				read it <a

			</p>
			<p class="mt-4">
				I enjoy sharing about web development to anyone. That's one of reasons why I built this
				site, beside as my portofolio, this site will be functioning as my blog where I share about
				web dev or everything in my mind. It also helps me to understand something better, take a
				notes!
			</p>
			<p class="mt-4">Finally, thank you for visiting my site, means a lot!</p>
